# Shlink On Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/H19Oeo?referralCode=IFlm92)

## What is this template?

Shlink is a self-hosted URL shortener that enables you to create, and track the usage of  "short" URLs that redirect to other, longer, URLs.  Shlink also provides analytics on URL usage, such as visit counts and geographic location of the visitors. Shlink is designed for those looking for a private, customizable alternative to public URL shortening services.

This template provides access to both [the Shlink API](https://shlink.io/documentation/api-docs/) for programmatic access and [the Shlink web client](https://shlink.io/documentation/shlink-web-client/) (behind HTTP basic-authentication) for web-based configuration and management.
